### 💼 Experience
* **Researcher | A2IL Lab, University at Buffalo** (Aug 2025 – Dec 2025) [Link](https://github.com/sahillarious/BOLT).
  * Developed the B.O.L.T (Behavioral Object Locomotion & Tracking) system for the Unitree Go2 quadruped, enabling autonomous, real-time vision-guided object following.
  * Designed a decoupled, low-latency architecture that separates perception from motion control to ensure control decisions are driven by the most recent sensory feedback.
  * Engineered a perception pipeline utilizing a quantized YOLOv8n model optimized with ONNX for edge deployment on a Jetson Nano, achieving a near-perfect mAP@0.5 of 0.995.
  * Implemented a Finite-State Machine (FSM) control layer to abstract noisy perception data into stable behaviors: Search, Approach, Creep, Hold, and Backup.
  * Achieved an average end-to-end system latency of 48 ms with a target tracking success rate exceeding 90% in indoor environments.
  * Optimized real-world distance and orientation estimation using camera intrinsic calibration and focal-length-based geometric depth approximation.
  * Created and annotated a custom dataset of target objects, applying geometric and photometric augmentations to improve model generalization under varied lighting and backgrounds

* **Analyst | Capgemini** (Dec 2022 – May 2024)
  * Optimized complex SQL queries and PL/SQL packages within Oracle EBS, resulting in a 40% reduction in execution time for high-volume supply chain operations.
  * Automated critical data transformations and streamlined business processes across Order Management, Procurement, and Inventory Control systems.
  * Resolved over 100 production incidents and maintained 100% SLA compliance while supporting mission-critical batch jobs for an aerospace client.
  * Developed structured operational dashboards and reports focused on BOMs and inventory to support strategic stakeholder decision-making

* **ML Intern | EQlibria** (Dec 2021 – Feb 2022)
  * Deployed speech-to-text and summarization pipelines using OpenAI Whisper and Gemini APIs to process long-form therapist-patient video sessions.
  * Built a context-aware multilingual chatbot utilizing NLP (NER and intent classification) and Naive Bayes models to achieve 93% accuracy in user personality classification.
  * Developed web scraping pipelines to curate metadata for therapist discovery and integrated this data directly into the mobile application engine.
  * Implemented class weighting techniques to resolve data imbalance, ensuring robust performance for automated mental health interventions.
 
* **Digital Image Processing Intern | Grey Scientific Labs** (Sept 2021 – Oct 2021) [Link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahilsawant01/details/experience/1635473734022/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAC6oP24Bgsp5t7QDLiKW84OztEAC-ZWeu3M)
  * Engineered image preprocessing and noise reduction pipelines for medical datasets, organizing 400+ DICOM images for AI-based diagnostic analysis.
  * Developed automation scripts to convert and stitch high-resolution microscopic medical scans, reducing manual preprocessing time by 15%.
